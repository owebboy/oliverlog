        <h1>How to change the world</h1>
        2015-10-16
        
      </div>
      <p>Malala Yousafzai, an eighteen year old Pakistani activist, is a symbol for change. As first-world countries continue  to outpace third-world countries, we tend to forget about the horrors of oppressive governments and the depths they will go to utterly brainwash every single soul they touch. With the frustration caused by the Taliban’s humanitarian crimes, such as Malala’s shooting, international outcry for the downfall of the Taliban and other oppressors is just incredible. </p>
<p>Malala is changing the world. She is a symbol for change and for a future where girls can go to school and everyone has equal rights. These ideals are what begins the upward trend  of a new international society where everyone can have every basic human right possible. </p>
<p>However, some people feel that society should be oppressive towards change and freedom. These people are usually those who do not have to deal with the suffering that comes along with a dictatorship.  These people do not like change or even considering better worlds. They just want their life to stay the same, while forgetting about the rest of the world. This way of thinking is unrevolutionary and sad. It is not how the world is supposed to work, and it is hurting the world’s technology and innovation. The world could be awesome if we had more freedom globally and did not have terrorists who oppress incredible ideas. </p>
<p>Every single revolution was started by an idea, and every idea was started by a person. People change the world, dictating how it works and how people think. People should be able to make their own decisions based on their individual thoughts, not what others think. Education beats guns and weapons. Knowledge is power, and once you have it, you cannot take it away. The people who can create change are people like Malala.</p>
